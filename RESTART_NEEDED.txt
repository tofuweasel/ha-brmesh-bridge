⚠️ ADDON RESTART REQUIRED ⚠️

After pulling v0.30.8, you need to:

1. Go to Home Assistant → Settings → Add-ons → ESP BLE Bridge
2. Click "RESTART" button
3. Wait for addon to come back online
4. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear JavaScript cache
5. Check that version shows "v0.30.8" in top right of UI

The new /api/pairing/discover route won't exist until the addon restarts with the new code!

Alternatively, run:
ha addons restart esp-ble-bridge

Then hard refresh your browser.
